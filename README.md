k-means model has grouped the  rows into the same cluster, 5 We can see these two observations both have Annual Income (k$)values around 16
the algorithm has grouped the data into eight  clusters 0 to 7.
Cluster 5 has the lowest average Annual Income (k$)	and Spending Score (1-100) among all the clusters, while cluster 4 has the highest values.With this pivot table, we are able to compare clusters between them using their summarised values.
This extra parameter is used in altair to specify the type of value for this column. :N means the information contained in this column is categorical
